we couldn't find any apartment/household goods relating to your search? want to be notified when something comes up?

how does stack overflow results pop up on google search? if someone googles "apartments in ikeja", results from corpers.online should pop up

hmm, AI as they type ? then Places suggestions as they type ?!!!!!!!!!?!??????????????????

Add video capabilities, make use of the picture tag, and lazy loading... c'mon

we still have search and places... jeez

use holder.js with statecode or map of the state the person is from or a crazy pic like that for lazy loading before the actual pic/avatar of the person loads

can we make this better... find a way to get swift user feed back...and suggestions... ask them what they want
Aside from your PPA, and other relevant places NYSC hangouts (think NYSC Offices, LGA Offices etc.). Get to know the town and other eats outs recommended by other corpers. this would mean that by extension, corpers would recommend alot of things for other corpers --eatouts, hangouts and other things and PLACES too.

ask corpers how much their PPAs pay them, if they do at all, it'll help other corpers know how much to expect from their PPAs and plan and it'll help us too to know how to better target high earning corpers... and make other deductions... like advise them to save and stuff. partner with adron homes to see if they can buy a land and acquire properties while serving... and in turn sell this 'property acquiring service' to the general public. more meaningful partnerships can be made.
