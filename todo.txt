LESS, BUT BETTER https://uxdesign.cc/great-products-do-less-things-but-better-5dde0ee3fc76

There is an old Peter Drucker quote – "what gets measured gets managed" – 


"To give an example, instead of solely giving feedback upon submission of a form, let’s provide feedback along the way on a field per field basis. This can be as simple as showing a list of requirements for a password field: whenever the password meets one of the listed requirements, the requirement gets ticked off; when all requirements are met, the input field turns green indicating the user can move on to the next input field." from https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2019/03/learnability-in-ux-design/

USER RETENTIONS ?!?!??!?


>>> so what happens to all your previous data (posts and chats and how you can be reached) when you change statecode ?
we couldn't find any apartment/household goods relating to your search? want to be notified when something comes up?

how does stack overflow results pop up on google search? if someone googles "apartments in ikeja", results from corpers.online should pop up

hmm, AI as they type ? then Places suggestions as they type ?!!!!!!!!!?!??????????????????

Add video capabilities, make use of the picture tag, and lazy loading... c'mon

we still have search and places... jeez

use holder.js with statecode or map of the state the person is from or a crazy pic like that for lazy loading before the actual pic/avatar of the person loads

can we make this better... find a way to get swift user feed back...and suggestions... ask them what they want
Aside from your PPA, and other relevant places NYSC hangouts (think NYSC Offices, LGA Offices etc.). Get to know the town and other eats outs recommended by other corpers. this would mean that by extension, corpers would recommend alot of things for other corpers --eatouts, hangouts and other things and PLACES too.

ask corpers how much their PPAs pay them, if they do at all, it'll help other corpers know how much to expect from their PPAs and plan and it'll help us too to know how to better target high earning corpers... and make other deductions... like advise them to save and stuff. partner with adron homes to see if they can buy a land and acquire properties while serving... and in turn sell this 'property acquiring service' to the general public. more meaningful partnerships can be made.

in update profile section or page, // ask if they want an accommodation and where would they want it to be


/////// make the pop up be entirely in view when a ppa is clicked from the index page.


also once people are done negotiating their goods or accommodation space we remove it from the timeline, it means we're done with it.


//// concerning the total_num_unread_msg on account.ejs page, it is not exactly accurate because if a user is logged in and a new message is sent while they are in this page, if they open chat page and navigate back here, it shows the old/previous number of unread messages
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> use https://www.javascripting.com/view/knwl-js to parse dates and time and places in texts

use https://www.javascripting.com/view/faye for push notifications ?!?!
use https://www.javascripting.com/view/dimple for some insights, ...

for the images in account http://stylehatch.github.io/photoset-grid/ & https://www.javascripting.com/view/photoset-grid ---- https://www.javascripting.com/view/imgliquid

lazy load images https://www.javascripting.com/view/unveil & https://www.javascripting.com/view/jquery_lazyload

[[[[[[[[[[ if our server is down, it shouldn't say, since you're offline!!! we should do better error reporting for EVERYTHING ]]]]]]]]]]

don't move to the next slide until the current form is filled.

############# refactor account.ejs so that all re-occuring code is written just once


corpers should be able to mark or select accommodations to compare with later ...make savings towards paying for a rent and stuffs... add reminders towards acquiring a rent and also know when someone else got the rent if they have enabled 'watch' feature on a rent... the watch feature is to know if other corpers are intrested in the rent and if they've acquired it (by any means, either they came in to agreement with the landlord and stuffs like that)... yeaaaaaaaaaaaa, corpers can come together to pay rent by contributing money or alawi together ...make group chats possible... maybe find a way to integrate group chats with existing chatting apps... or not!!!!

during chat, you should be able to video chat and call... and get the co-ordinates of videos and pictures sent... for authenticity

there should not be any undefined.

make the whole post and accommodation chronologically arranged

always use https://github.com/tj/ejs/tree/0.8.3#features

improve the search bar at the index so corpers can search for stuffs according to states and LGAs then indicate at the other sides that their searches are based on results close to them, i.e. results in their LGAs because we wouldn't think they'd need results from elsewhere

what if we make photographers do a contest. we make them take pictures of lodges and the best one wins something https://www.pinterest.com/pin/390616967679901314/ and we make it clear we want pictures of rural places.

so the way there's "someone is typing..." when chatting, why can't we have, new accommodation or sale or location coming through as someone is writing a post... oh and only people in a certain location can see post from other corpers closer to them, say you're in Abia. you should only see sale and accommodations from corpers in Abia. then we can turn it up a notch, you can only see post from corpers in your LGA and the ones close to you. we can use this as a motivation and nodge for corpers to complete their profile and indicate their LGA and other stuffs. we'd be and must be telling them why we need all these info. [this would be in the quickly reports section]

make it so that when, supposedly corpers, click on #ServiceYear on the sign up page, it opens up twitter so they tweet about something regarding corpers online, something they would want to tweet. also <!-- link our twitter account with this a tag. it'll be an a tag, that'll open up a twitter page and also try to connect twitter with it, show relevant tweets about corpers by picking certain hashtags and keywords and display them in a sidebar -->

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
sometimes the req.session data is not correct.

if you duplicate a tab, and login with that tab, it overrides the session object of the previous tab it was duplicated from. we could use url parameter to avoid this [but i personally hate giving too much information in the url]
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////



>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.

we should be able to tell dates in texts and suggests to remind them of their meetings for say an exchange. if they click on a date, we suggest when we think the date is and ask or try to infer what is happening on that date and if they need a reminder.

say for example we see a random 'Thursday' or 'thur' or any of this short informal way of spelling, we try to check the words before and after it and try to ask, if we can't infer, what is happening on that data...

ask, if it is a meet up for an exchange or whatnot, the location of the meet up so we try to plot it in the map and see what's up

http://www.inspireux.com/2014/06/21/methods-to-achieve-user-delight/
Designers like to talk about achieving the ultimate goal of “user delight.” In fact, it’s one of our primary goals where I work at RelateIQ. It’s not enough to just provide information and functionality anymore. Successful product teams go one step further and aim to delight their users. But, what exactly does that mean? Below are some ways of thinking about user delight and what you can do to create more delightful experiences.


-Be Smart
Anticipate my needs and be one step ahead of me. It’s unexpectedly nice when a product knows what I’m trying to do before even I do.
Use technology wisely to do things automatically and intelligently. Don’t make me do a lot of manual work to get things done.
Prevent me from making errors. Don’t blame me for doing something incorrectly. Make resolving problems easy and friction-free.
Be smart and figure out what you need to know without making me give it to you. Don’t ask me to give you superfluous information about myself.
-Be Friendly and Helpful
Give your product a personality through humor and a friendly tone. I don’t want to be using another stale and boring product. Make me smile.
Speak to me like you would if you were talking to a friend. Humanize your product. Corporate and technical terms are frustrating to read.
Go above and beyond when I need to contact you for help. Don’t just give me automated responses. I want to feel like you care.
Find ways of turning negative experiences back into positive experiences. Things can and will go wrong, but leave me feeling positive about your organization by responding in a helpful way.
-Be Valuable
Make each step meaningful and purposeful. Don’t make me click through a bunch of extra steps that are just preventing me from getting things done.
Give me something valuable in return for using your product. This isn’t just a one way street. Reward me in unexpected ways.
Show me value immediately. Don’t make me sign up or go through a lengthy learning process before I can get anything beneficial out of your product.
-Be Engaging
Pay attention to the details. Don’t always go for the “easy” or expected approach when a little something extra could create a better experience. Focus on the little big details.
Use transitions and animations in a clever and useful way that supports the task I’m trying to complete or augments the information that I’m trying to consume. Static interfaces are boring, but using too many animations can also be annoying and distracting.
-Be Convenient and Accessible
Let me do what I’m trying to do on any device. Don’t punish me by hiding content just because I’m using a different type of device than you were expecting me to use.
Let me focus on the content and doing what I need to do. Don’t make me think about how to use your website or application. Stay out of my way.
Make your product work well with others. Don’t make me bounce between products just to get something done. Make moving between products seamless.
Focus on accessibility for all users. Don’t frustrate me by making your content difficult to consume if I have a physical impairment.
-Be Consistent
Make your product consistently snappy to load and use. I don’t want to have to wait around to get things done, and any delay will impact my experience.
Be consistent across the entire product ecosystem. Consistency builds trust, and trust breeds loyalty. Delight can’t be achieved if that trust is broken.
-Be Aligned Around Delight
You won’t be able to achieve user delight by cherry picking any of these principles. One isolated element of delight can easily be squashed by negative elements of the experience. In order to be successful, your entire organization has to be ruthlessly focused on achieving delightful user experiences. Be wary of the “oh, we can fix that later” mindset. It’s much harder to make up for a negative experience once it’s been introduced.

Get ideas and insights for achieving delight by watching and responding to your users’ aspirations and behaviors. Have your entire organization get involved in listening to the people who are using your product. You’ll quickly find out where your product has opportunities to improve. Think of your users as people, not just numbers completing transactions. Understanding the context around how someone interacts with your product can help you identify how to be delightful within that context.

Finally, find ways of measuring delight. Quantitatively, you can measure usage and engagement with a product through metrics. However, numbers don’t tell the whole story. Just because people are using a product doesn’t mean it is delightful. Create systems for qualitatively listening to your users and finding out whether your product is meaningful and emotionally impactful.

"I believe that logic + emotion are a winning combination. When useful and useable meet delight—great things happen. It’s about balance." – David Armano





Augmented reality

Using AR within web design is still very much in the beginner stages, but it’s catching on fast. Glasses retailer Specsavers allows viewers to try on different frames using AR, and IKEA has made it possible to view certain pieces of furniture in your own home with its new app called Place. Don’t forget that before the hype cooled down significantly, Pokémon Go was the hottest thing in the world for a while, and it was all because of augmented reality. AR will change a lot in the next 5 years, but expect some more leaps and bounds in 2020, as this is a new and exciting way for viewers to be fully immersed in both the digital and physical worlds.

from http://designbeep.com/2019/12/05/make-sure-youre-aware-of-these-web-design-trends-for-2020/

how about using, AR, once someone rents a place, they take a video, we fill up the rooms with things and house hold items they can get from corpers online, and arrange the items for them using various themes. . . we train our AI from watching decoration videos online a lot

the more we provide the service similar to what Places provide, we can face lift the nation more and more, do away with poor looking designs...



... look at https://designrfix.com/3d/ways-to-get-a-3d-effect-of-a-product-image

do that for all the people selling clothes and shoes by the road side... make them use the service, find a way to handle packaging and maybe branding (buy using the logo or name of the market they're selling from and the name of his shop/store ... to increase awareness of the dress)... DO ALSO FOR SHOES
like https://www.core77.com/posts/92783/An-Interview-with-HGTV-Dream-Home-Designer-Brian-Patrick-Flynn?utm_source=core77&utm_medium=from_title do a collection of how the design is acheieved and what inspires the taste of people ...

make corpers do a kind of virtual tour of their accommodation so other corpers can preview it before renting
using https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2016/03/12/mozilla-a-frame-powers-new-amnesty-international-virtual-reality-website-syria360/
like how they did http://www.360syria.com/ making it look so real... we'll do that for rooms and other places... so corpers and probably even more around.

sth about formatting emails using "!important" in css https://www.emailonacid.com/blog/article/email-development/emailology_media_queries_demystified_min-width_and_max-width/
use node core module: zlib, for compression

use a lot of promises, turn things into modules

centralize logging (https://dev.to/btsuhako/comment/a9l0)

connect people such that you get what they want, connect them with others who have what they want, for instance, someone is looking for an apartment close to a place or a ppa... another person in that ppa who stay close to the ppa in a place where the person wants ...we'd connect them together... sharp sharp...
