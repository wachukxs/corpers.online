## Roadmap and TODOs
* Remove config/config.json and config.js from git history and repo
* Get a list of API best practices we need to follow.
  * Like using /api/v2/ etc.
* footer and header should be thier own pages and automatically embbed
* Show that an item is HOT by showing how many conversation is going on about the sale of it
* maybe resize profile images with image processing libraries.
* alerts for when corpers post certain items for sales or accommodation specs for rent
* Use [this link](https://www.crusaderpensions.com/download/local_govt_codes_.pdf) for LGA codes too.
* Use opensource Ghost.org to host our blog. Use it's creator functionality. Make corp members write blog post ... and maybe pay them to write these. So other corp members can follow these corp members. Make them create thread or corp stories.

## Some wants
