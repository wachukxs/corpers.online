# A tool
Firstly for the people in khaki, then for the green and white people, then for all others.

## On Security

* 12 factor.net


## Roadmap and TODOs
* Remove config/config.json and config.js from git history and repo
* Have color coded logs/log messages.
* Get a list of API best practices we need to follow.
  * Like using /api/v2/ etc.
* ~~footer and header should be their own pages and automatically embedded.~~ ðŸš«
* Show that an item is HOT by showing how many conversation is going on about the sale of it
* maybe resize profile images with image processing libraries.
* alerts for when corp members post certain items for sales or accommodation specs for rent
* Use [this link](https://www.crusaderpensions.com/download/local_govt_codes_.pdf) for LGA codes too.
* Use open source ghost.org to host our blog. Use it's creator functionality. Make corp members write blog post ... and maybe pay them to write these. So other corp members can follow these corp members. Make them create thread or corp stories.
* Have a find your PPA listing. Like a listing of PPAs. Complete with proper maps (to come later). A directory of places. How do we get a list of schools? Tell them to attach a picture of the school: like a sign board. Or something. And then we can give directions.
  * We need to cater for how corp members will add location and it'll be shown on google maps? Or we'd look for a good mapping library. We could actually launch with this. Search how similar organizations get people to contribute public data. Look for a video of how Google started doing this. Search how to store geo data. Use the app myself to see the usability. Have a directory of schools.

## Tech RULES
* TODO: DB columns and table names should be in snake_case.

## Some wants
* Would [knowing when a form is auto filled](https://material.angular.io/cdk/text-field/overview) ever be useful to us?
* Using AI to [Auto identify images](https://aihub.cloud.google.com/p/products%2F150687a7-cb7c-4066-899d-ebfbc0aac5d3)?
* Use [winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) as logger
